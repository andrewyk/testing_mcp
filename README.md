# Ode to Code

In silent halls where logic dwells,
A spark begins, a story tells.
Through loops and lines, the world takes shape,
In every bug, a chance to make.

From thought to screen, ideas flow,
With every branch, new dreams will grow.
So here we write, and here we dream—
A world remade in code's bright gleam.
